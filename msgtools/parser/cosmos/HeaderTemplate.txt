# This is Cosmos command and telemetry definitions for the fields of the header,
# which isn't ever actually used that way within Cosmos.  Instead, every command
# and telemetry message needs to contain the header fields directly within themselves!
#  <DECLARATIONS>

# Cosmos does however need an Interface defined, and a Protocol:
#     https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/interfaces
#     https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/protocols
#
# For network communications, Cosmos can use a TCP/IP Server or Client:
#     https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/interfaces#tcpip-server-interface
#     https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/interfaces#tcpip-client-interface
#     If we have msgserver handle all I/O with the hardware, it'd make sense to have Cosmos
#     connect to msgserver using a TCP/IP Client connection!
#
# To interoperate with msgtools' msgserver or client applications, the "LENGTH" Protocol should be used in Cosmos.
#     https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/protocols#length-protocol

# If we're going to use a TCP/IP client and LENGTH Protocol, there's still some decisions to be made.
# To autogenerate the INTERFACE line for use with this header, we'd need to specify:
# 1) The type of Interface (TCP/IP Server or Client, or Serial, or UDP, or MQTT, or something else)
# 2) The IP address to connect to (perhaps localhost by default)
# 3&4) msgserver uses port 5678 by default for TCP/IP, and the same port is used to send and receive.
# 5) write timeout in seconds
# 6) read timeout in seconds (Nil / None to block on read)
# 7) Protocol = LENGTH
# 8) Length Bit Offset.  This needs to be the location in bits from the start of the header where the length field is
# 9) Length Bit Size.  The size in bits of the length field.
# 10) Length Value Offset.  Value to add to the length field (zero for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP)
# 11) Bytes per Count.  1 for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP.
# 12) Length Endianness.
# 13) Discard Leading Bytes.  zero for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP
# 14) Sync Pattern.  Left blank or Nil/None for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP
# 15) Max Length.  Could be inferred from number of bits of length field, but can leave blank or nil for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP
# 16) Fill Length and Sync Pattern.  Must be True for interoperating with msgtools on TCP/IP.
