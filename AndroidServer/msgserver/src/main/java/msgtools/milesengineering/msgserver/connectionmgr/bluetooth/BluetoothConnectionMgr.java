/**
 * This is a Bluetooth SPP oriented connection manager.  It does not handle pairing, or discovery.
 * It only looks for bonded connections and tries to establish an SPP connection for data exchange.
 *
 * This class is threaded a bit differently than other connection managers because Bluetooth
 * sockets don't implement a selectable interface.  Therefore each connection is spun up on its
 * own thread, and sends listener events directly for connection etc.
 *
 * The main loop of this class is presently empty.  In the future we can put a retry on bonded devices
 * host a server socket, and other things in the loop.  Meantime it's just snoozing and burning
 * unnecessary CPU. This choice was made to allow us to leverage the BaseConnectionMgr class as
 * it provides more than just a processing thread for us.
 *
 * It's nice to have this class cleanup all the connections it's spawned.  To do that
 * we're making this class a connection event listener itself to maintain an internal
 * list of Bluetooth only connections.  Making this class look a little weird.
 *
 * The other weirdity is we're interested in broadcast Bluetooth intents, which require a top level
 * activity or similar to capture.  Thus we spin up a utility class to receive intents and
 * invoke APIs on this class as a shim.
